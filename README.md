# DevSecOps Pipeline Demo

NOTE: This demo is for my homelab and assumes Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security, OpenShift Pipelines, and OpenShift GitOps have been previously installed. For more information on this setup, review my [cluster-config](https://github.com/redhatryan/cluster-config) repo. This particular demo is a modified version of the [devsecops-demo]https://github.com/rcarrata/devsecops-demo.

This DevSecOps CICD pipeline demo leverages several technologies such as:

- [OpenShift Pipelines](https://www.openshift.com/learn/topics/ci-cd)
- [OpenShift GitOps](https://www.openshift.com/blog/announcing-openshift-gitops)
- [OpenShift Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes](https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/advanced-cluster-security-for-kubernetes-datasheet)
- [OpenShift Container Registry](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/registry/architecture-component-imageregistry.html)

Vulnerability and configuration management methods included in this demo are the following:

- **Static application security testing (SAST)**, which analyzes code under development for vulnerabilities and quality issues.
- **Software composition analysis (SCA)**, which examines dependent packages included with applications, looking for known vulnerabilities and licensing issues.
- **Interactive application security testing (IAST)** and **dynamic application security testing (DAST)** tools, which analyze running applications to find execution vulnerabilities.
- **Configuration management** with analysis and management of application and infrastructure configurations in DevOps. Traditionally this was not used as a way to improve security. But properly managing configurations in a GitOps process can strengthen security by improving change controls, identifying configuration defects that can reduce the attack surface, and signing and tracking authorship for better accountability and opportunities to improve.
- **Image risk** is any risk associated with a container image. This includes vulnerable dependencies, embedded secrets, bad configurations, malware, or images that are not trusted.

This pipeline also improves security adding the following Open Source components:

- [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/)
- [Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/products/repository-oss?topnav=true)
- [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/)
- [Gogs](https://gogs.io/)
- [Git Webhook](https://tekton.dev/docs/triggers/)
- [Gatling](https://gatling.io/)
- [Zap Proxy](https://www.zaproxy.org/)


# Overview

## 1. Continuous Integration

On every push to the spring-petclinic git repository on Gogs git server, the following steps are executed within the Tekton pipeline:

<img align="center" width="950" src="docs/pics/pipeline1.png">

0. [Code is cloned](docs/Steps.md#source-clone) from Gogs git server and the unit-tests are run
1. [Dependency report](docs/Steps.md#dependency-report) from the source code is generated and uploaded to the report server repository.
2. [Unit tests](docs/Steps.md#unit-tests) are executed and in parallel the code is [analyzed by Sonarqube](docs/Steps.md#code-analysis-sonarqube) for anti-patterns.
3. Application is packaged as a JAR and [released to Sonatype Nexus](docs/Steps.md#release-app) snapshot repository
4. A [container image is built](docs/Steps.md#build-image) in DEV environment using S2I, and pushed to OpenShift internal registry, and tagged with spring-petclinic:[branch]-[commit-sha] and spring-petclinic:latest

## 2. DevSecOps steps using Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes

Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes controls clusters and applications from a single console, with built-in security policies.

Using roxctl and ACS API, we integrated in our pipeline several additional security steps into our DevSecOps pipeline:

5. [Image Scanning using ACS Scanner](docs/Steps.md#image-scan) of the image generated and pushed in step 4.

<img align="center" width="750" src="docs/pics/result9_1.png">

6. [Image Check](docs/Steps.md#image-check) of the build-time violations of the different security policies defined in ACS
7. [Checks build-time and deploy-time violations](docs/Steps.md#deployment-check) of security policies in ACS of the YAML deployment files used for deploy our application.

<img align="center" width="500" src="docs/pics/pipeline2.png">

NOTE: these 3 steps are executed in parallel for saving time in our DevSecOps pipeline.

8. Kubernetes [kustomization files updated](docs/Steps.md#update-deployment) with the latest image [commit-sha] in the overlays for dev. This will ensure that our Application are deployed using the specific built image in this pipeline.

## 3. Continuous Delivery

Argo CD continuously monitor the configurations stored in the Git repository and uses Kustomize to overlay environment specific configurations when deploying the application to DEV and STAGE environments.

<img align="center" width="550" src="docs/pics/pipeline3.png">

9. The ArgoCD applications syncs the manifests in our gogs git repositories, and applies the changes automatically into the namespaces defined:

<img align="center" width="350" src="docs/pics/pipeline5.png">

and deploys every manifest that is defined in the branch/repo of our application:

<img align="center" width="750" src="docs/pics/pipeline6.png">

## 4. PostCI - Pentesting and Performance Tests

Once our application is deployed, we need to ensure of our application is stable and performant and also that nobody can hack our application easily.

10. Our CI in Openshift Pipelines [waits until the ArgoCD app is fully sync](docs/Steps.md#wait-application) and our app and all the resources are deployed
11. The [performance tests are cloned](docs/Steps.md#performance-tests-clone) into our pipeline workspace
12. The [pentesting is executed](docs/Steps.md#pentesting-tests-using-zap-proxy) using the web scanner [OWASP Zap Proxy](https://www.zaproxy.org) using a baseline in order to check the possible vulnerabilities, and a Zap Proxy report is uploaded to the report server repository.
13. In parallel the [performance tests are executed](docs/Steps.md#performance-tests-using-gatling) using the load test [Gatling](https://gatling.io/) and a performance report is uploaded to the report server repository.

## 5. Notifications

ACS can be integrated with several Notifier for notify if certain events happened in the clusters managed. In our case, we integrated with Slack in order to receive notifications when some Policies are violated in order to have more useful information:

<img align="center" width="400" src="docs/pics/result20.png">

These policies notification can be enabled by each system policy enabled in our system, so you can create your own notification baseline in order to have only the proper information received in your systems.

NOTE: By now the integration is manual. WIP to automate it.

## 6. Image Signing and Pipeline Signing

The original demo can be extended to use Cosign to Sign Image artifacts and also to sign the Tekton Build Pipeline via Tekton [Chaining](https://github.com/tektoncd/chains).

To extend the pipeline run the extend.sh script

```sh
   ./extend.sh
```

This will install Noobaa(Object Storage), Quay, and create a pod for cosign secret generation and verification.It will also install the tekton chains operator and integrate with ACS policies to generate violations for non signed images.

After installation the pipeline will build images to quay and have a task that signs the image.  
<img align="center" width="750" src="docs/pics/pipeline-with-sign-task.png">

We also create a policy in ACS that will generate a violation for every unsigned image
<img align="center" width="750" src="docs/pics/acs-trusted-signature-violation.png">

Pipeline can be run normally via the Run the demo Instructions below.

After Pipeline is run Quay will show the image signed by Cosign
<img align="center" width="750" src="docs/pics/quay-with-signatures.png">

Since we have Tekton Chaining enabled, successfully completed Taskruns will also be annotated with cosign signatures and payload information.
<img align="center" width="750" src="docs/pics/taskrun.png">

And we can verify the signature and payload information of our last successful pipelinerun using the below command.

```sh
   ./demo.sh sign-verify
```

## Security Policies and CI Violations

In this demo, we can control the security policies applied into our pipelines, scanning the images and analysing the different deployments templates used for deploy our applications.

We can enforce the different Security Policies in ACS, failing our CI pipelines if a violation of this policy appears in each step of our DevSecOps pipelines (steps 6,7,8).

This Security Policies can be defined at BUILD level (during the build/push of the image), or at DEPLOYMENT level (preventing to deploy the application).

For example this Security Policy, checks if a RH Package Manager (dnf,yum) is installed in your Image, and will FAIL the pipeline if detects that the image built contains any RH Package Manager:

<img align="center" width="470" src="docs/pics/pipeline4.png">

This ensures that we have the total control of our pipelines, and no image is pushed into your registry or deployed in your system that surpases the Security Policies defined.

### Fixing the image

To show a complete demo and show the transition from a "bad image" to an image that passes the build enforcement, we can update the Tekton task of the image build and fix the image. In this example, we will be enabling the enforcement of the "Red Hat Package Manager in Image" policy in ACS, which will fail our pipeline at the image-check as both `yum` and `rpm` package managers are present in our base image.

Update the tekton task:

1. Delete the `s2i-java-11` task
   1. With the UI: From the OpenShift UI, make sure you are in the cicd project and then go to Pipelines > Tasks and delete the `s2i-java-11` task.
   2. With the Tekton cli `tkn task delete s2i-java-11`
2. Apply the new update task: `kubectl apply -f fix-image/s2ijava-mgr.yaml`
3. Re-run the pipeline, your deployment now succeeds.

You can check the `s2ijava-mgr.yaml` file for more details. We have added a step to this Task which leverages buildah to remove the package managers from the image (search for "rpm" or "yum" in the file).
